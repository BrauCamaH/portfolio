I am a voracious reader, I like specially science fiction and encyclopedic novels books, for me is really important get knowledege that can enriquece as person, I use books to understand the wordl always looking for a different point of view that can make me grow as person.

## Sports

I practice sports like basketball and soccer, also I am of a movement that try to return the mesoamerican ball game called "ulama de cadera". Which uses only your hips to hit a solid rubber ball of 3 to 4 kg. I am part of the team of jalisco where we make exhibitions and compete in a national level. 

## Sotware development
 
I am technology enthusiast, the programing language that I use are JavaScript and C#. I am into Web Development using React as frontend and Node js as backend. The reason is because not only you can create web pages and aplications, also is posible to create mobile and desktop apps. Also I have found in React a amazing comunity and source of documentation.
Also I have knowledege in Video Games, this is mainly because I was part of a program "128 Bits". Where people that are working at Game Development shared their knowledege, the purpose was create a team to make a video game. I took this course at the city of guadalajara from the parte of "Ciudad Creativa Digital". But there was some problems and the program was canceled, despite that I entered in a new world being able to use Unity to create 2D and 3D experiencies.
